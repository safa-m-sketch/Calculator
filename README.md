# Calculator
Followed the tutorial by Devression to learn more about Tkinter and used the knowledge I learned to add personal tweaks that include dark mode, and some keyboard input bindings. By making these changes, I learned to adjust the grid's row and column weights to ensure the interface had a proper layout.

This project can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentages 

Here are some keyboard shortcuts that are included in this program
+ - / * %
Enter (on keyboard), which is the = button on the interface
Backspace (on keyboard), which is to remove one digit
Delete (on keyboard) to remove all digits
